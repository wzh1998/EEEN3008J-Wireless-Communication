PART I. Overview

Gerneral
1. net type
nodes (join, dissociate) frequently
Therefore,
Ad-hoc
 
2. topology
quick & reliable comm
so, mesh network

UAV:
A. Type 
	need hovering & scouting at rapid pace
	nodes could die out or replace
	As a result,
	MANETs - Mobile Ad hoc Networks
	&
	VANETs - Vehicular Ad hoc Networks, star (road side infraustructure)
   

B. Topology
	control station, star (control center) / adhoc / mesh (UAVs)

C. Energy contraints:
	Not as easy as vehicular Net and vehicle Net

D. Tolerance
	Reason: 
	Deployed in extreme situation, Net may get partitioned frequently. Require MAC & Network layer changes, also has to be self-organizing (IMPORTANT).

	May Cause: 
	connectivity cannot be guaranteed, 

	Needs: 
	1. delay & disruption tolerance (incoorperating store-carry-forward capatibilities)
	2. Robust inter-UAV Networks
