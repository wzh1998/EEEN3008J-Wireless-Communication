PART 2. Categorization & Characteristic of UAV Networks

A. Multi-UAV Networks
Advantages

	1. Allaw Small & less expensive UAVs in a coordinated manner
	*2. can work co-operatively and extend coverage by acting as relays

	Degree of mobility depends. {
		providing communication from a disaster (earthquake)
		&
		agriculture/forest surveillance
	}

	3. automatically reconfiguration

	4. Comparasion of energy & bandwidth
	single UAV system has to maintain links with CS, BA, server & provide function  ->  heavy contraints on battery and bandwidth

	Multi-UAV less connection & feed & comm withm others through mesh network

	5. Less expensive (acquire & maintainance)

	** TABLE II

	* 6. Complete search faster in specific problems, robust to loss. 
Drawbacks
	
	Add complexities to the network

B. Feature of the UAV neetworks

	1. Infrastructure-Based / ad-hoc
	2. server / client: UAV对比vehicle & mobile
	3. star / mesh
	4. Delay and Disruptions Prone Networks

C. Categorization

	** TABLE IV

D. Self-Organization
	form structure autumatically based on guidance (or not)
	fault tolerance through reconfigure
